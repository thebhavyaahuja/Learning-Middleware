    "raw_model_output": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants me to generate six learning objectives for a module on Hubble's Law. Let me start by recalling what Hubble's Law is. It's the observation that galaxies are moving away from us, and the further they are, the faster they're moving. Combined with the cosmological principle, this suggests the universe is expanding.\n\nThe context mentions that the universe's expansion is homogeneous, so the shape of triangles formed by points remains the same over time. The distances scale with the scale factor 'a(t)'. Also, the relative velocities are proportional to distance, which is the essence of Hubble's Law.\n\nNow, the user provided an example format. Each objective must start with an action verb like Understand, Explain, Analyze, etc. They need to be 8-18 words long and focus on theoretical and conceptual understanding. Also, the output should be a JSON array of strings.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure each objective is specific to Hubble's Law and the cosmological principle. Let me brainstorm possible objectives. \n\n1. Understand how Hubble's Law relates to the expansion of the universe. That's a good start. It's 8 words.\n\n2. Explain the relationship between redshift and distance in Hubble's Law. That's 10 words. But maybe \"Explain the relationship between redshift and distance in Hubble's Law\" is better.\n\n3. Analyze how the cosmological principle ensures uniform expansion. That's 10 words. But maybe \"Analyze the role of the cosmological principle in uniform expansion\" is better.\n\n4. Compare the scaling of distances with the scale factor 'a(t)' in expanding universe. That's 12 words. But maybe \"Compare the scaling of distances with the scale factor 'a(t)' in an expanding universe\" is more precise.\n\n5. Evaluate how Hubble's Law supports the Big Bang theory. That's 9 words. But maybe \"Evaluate the implications of Hubble's Law for the Big Bang theory\" is better.\n\n6. Describe the relationship between recession velocity and distance in Hubble's Law. That's 10 words. But maybe \"Describe the proportionality between recession velocity and distance in Hubble's Law\" is more accurate.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that the relative distances at time t are related to those at t0 by a(t). So maybe an objective about the scale factor. Also, the example in the context mentions that the shape of the triangle remains the same. So maybe an objective about the homogeneity.\n\nAnother angle: the cosmological principle implies the universe is homogeneous, so the expansion is uniform. So an objective could be about the implications of the cosmological principle on the expansion.\n\nAlso, the relative velocities are proportional to distance. So maybe an objective about that proportionality.\n\nLet me check the word counts again. Each objective must be 8-18 words. Let me make sure each is within that range.\n\n1. Understand the relationship between redshift and distance in Hubble's Law. (10 words)\n\n2. Explain the role of the cosmological principle in uniform expansion. (10 words)\n\n3. Analyze the scaling of distances with the scale factor 'a(t)' in an expanding universe. (12 words)\n\n4. Compare the proportionality of recession velocity to distance in Hubble's Law. (11 words)\n\n5. Evaluate the implications of Hubble's Law for the Big Bang theory. (10 words)\n\n6. Describe the homogeneity of expansion in an expanding universe. (10 words)\n\nWait, but the example in the context mentions that the shape of the triangle remains the same. So maybe an objective about that. Like \"Analyze how the shape of triangles remains constant during expansion.\" But that's 11 words.\n\nAlternatively, \"Analyze the homogeneity of expansion in an expanding universe.\" That's 1",

In 1902-1905\nMichaelson and Morley through an experiment found that thespeed of light in inertial frames is indeed\nindependent of the relative velocity between source and observer. Taking the result of the Michaelson and\nMorley experiment at face value, Einstein proposed a new theory, the Special Theory of Relativity, to make\nsense of all these.

Lorentz transformations are fundamental in special relativity, relating coordinates between two inertial frames moving at constant velocity relative to each other.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure each objective is 8-18 words and starts with an action verb. The example given uses verbs like Understand, Explain, Analyze, Compare, Evaluate, Describe, Apply. So I should stick to those.\n\nThe context mentions that the frames are parallel, with origins coinciding at t=0, and velocity along the x-axis. The transformations include time and space coordinates, with gamma factor and velocity terms. Also, the reverse transformations exist.\n\nSo, possible objectives could be about understanding the derivation, applying the formulas, comparing with Galilean transformations, evaluating the implications, describing the invariance of spacetime intervals, and analyzing the role of the Lorentz factor.\n\nWait, the user specified that the objectives should focus on theoretical and conceptual understanding. So I need to avoid just listing formulas but rather the underlying concepts. For example, understanding the principles behind the transformations, how they differ from Galilean, the role of the speed of light, the invariance of intervals, and the implications for simultaneity and length contraction.\n\nLet me check each objective for length and verb. \"Understand the derivation and principles of Lorentz transformations in special relativity.\" That's 14 words.

Let me check each one again. Are they all within the word count? Yes. Do they start with action verbs? Yes. Do they focus on theory and concepts? Yes. I think that's solid. Let me make sure there's no repetition and that each objective is distinct. The first is about derivation and principles, the second about the relationship between coordinates, third comparing with Galilean, fourth comparing invariance, fifth evaluating implications, sixth describing the role of speed of light. That covers different aspects.

It is called thespacetime. In analogy with the location of\na point in three dimensional space, lets introduce the concept of anevent, de\ufb01ned as a set of four coordinates\nx\u00b5 \u2318 (t, x, y, z) in the 4-dimensional spactime. Thex\u00b5 is a vector in 4D spacetime that transforms like\n(13) under a LT. It is noting but a location of an event in 4D spacetime. And it is analogous to specifying\nthe location of a point in a 3D space. Therefore,x\u00b5 is called a 4-vector\nx\u00b5 =( x0,x 1,x 2,x 3)=( x0,~ x) ,\nwhere ~xis the usual three vector.",
