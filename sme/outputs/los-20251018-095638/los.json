It's the observation that galaxies are moving away from each other with a velocity proportional to their distance, which implies the universe is expanding. The cosmological principle says the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales.\n\nThe user provided a context that mentions three points forming a triangle, with distances scaling over time. The relative distances at time t are proportional to a(t) times the distances at t0. The receding speeds are related to the scale factor. So the learning objectives need to focus on understanding the theoretical and conceptual aspects, not just placeholders.\n\nEach objective must start with an action verb: Understand, Explain, Analyze, Compare, Evaluate, Describe, Apply. They need to be 8-18 words. Let me think of possible objectives.\n\nFirst, maybe \"Understand how Hubble's Law relates to the expansion of the universe.\" That's 10 words. Good.\n\nNext, \"Explain the relationship between redshift and distance in Hubble's Law.\" That's 11 words. Wait, \"redshift\" is part of Hubble's Law, so that's relevant.\n\nThird, \"Analyze the implications of the cosmological principle on cosmic expansion.\" 14 words. The cosmological principle is key here.\n\nFourth, \"Compare the scaling of distances in a homogeneous universe over time.\" 14 words. The context mentions the triangle and scaling with a(t).\n\nFifth, \"Evaluate how Hubble's Law supports the Big Bang theory.\" 12 words.

The mathematical aspect is part of the law.\n\nWait, the user said \"actual learning objectives, NOT placeholders like 'LO1', 'LO2'\". So I need to make sure each is a real objective.

Hence,\nv / r, or v = H0r (6)\nwhere the constant of proportionalityH0 is called the Hubble constant.

Maxwell theory of light, in\nwhich the speed of light is constant in vacuum, do not refer to any particular frame of reference. Therefore,\nthe Maxwell\u2019s theory is in direct con\ufb02ict with the Galilean relativity. For example, the speed of light is\nconstant irrespective of the relative velocity between the observer and the source. So either the Maxwell\u2019s\ntheory of light is wrong or the Galilean transformations are not the correct transformations. In 1902-1905\nMichaelson and Morley through an experiment found that thespeed of light in inertial frames is indeed\nindependent of the relative velocity between source and observer. Taking the result of the Michaelson and\nMorley experiment at face value, Einstein proposed a new theory, the Special Theory of Relativity, to make\nsense of all these. The STR is based on the following two postulates by Einstein\n\u2022 laws of physics have the same form (invariant) in all inertial frames\n\u2022 for all inertial observers, the speed of light in vacuum is a constantc and is independent of the relative\nvelocity with the source of the light\nEinstein\u2019s task was to \ufb01nd a set of transformation rules between inertial frames that satisfy the above two\nstatements.

    "raw_model_output": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants me to generate six learning objectives for the Lorentz Transformations module. Let me start by recalling what the key concepts are here. The module is about Lorentz transformations, which are fundamental in special relativity. The context given mentions two frames, S and S', with parallel axes, and the transformation equations between their coordinates.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure each learning objective is 8-18 words and starts with an action verb. The examples provided use verbs like Understand, Explain, Analyze, Compare, Evaluate, Describe, Apply. So I should stick to these verbs.\n\nLet me think about the main points of Lorentz transformations. The key aspects are the mathematical form of the transformations, the role of the Lorentz factor gamma, the invariance of the speed of light, the relationship between space and time coordinates in different frames, and the reversal of transformations from S' to S.\n\nSo possible objectives could be:\n\n1. Understand the mathematical form of Lorentz transformations between inertial frames.\n2. Explain the role of the Lorentz factor in transforming coordinates between frames.\n3. Analyze how time and space coordinates change with relative velocity between frames.\n4. Compare the invariance of the speed of light in different reference frames.\n5. Evaluate the implications of Lorentz transformations on simultaneity and distance.\n6. Describe the reverse transformations from S' to S using the inverse of the Lorentz equations.\n\nWait, let me check the word count. The first one is 13 words. The second is 12. Third is 13. Fourth is 12. Fifth is 13. Sixth is 12. All within the required range. Also, each starts with a different action verb. The verbs used are Understand, Explain, Analyze, Compare, Evaluate, Describe. That covers the required verbs. \n\nI need to make sure they are actual learning objectives, not placeholders. Also, they should focus on theoretical and conceptual understanding. The objectives should not just be about applying formulas but understanding the underlying principles. \n\nAnother angle: the Lorentz transformations involve the gamma factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So an objective about the gamma factor's role is good. Also, the transformations for x, y, z, and t. The y and z coordinates are the same, which is a key point. \n\nAnother point is the invariance of the spacetime interval. But maybe that's more advanced. The user's context mentions the figure 8, which might show the setup of the frames. So the objectives should cover the setup, the equations, the transformations, and their implications.\n\nI think the six objectives I have cover the main points: understanding the form, explaining the gamma factor, analyzing the coordinate changes, comparing invariance, evaluating implications on simultaneity, and describing reverse transformations. \n\nI should check if each objective is unique and not redundant. For example, the first is about the mathematical form, the second about the gamma factor, the third about the analysis of coordinate changes, the fourth about invariance, the fifth about implications on simultaneity, and the sixth about reverse transformations. That seems comprehensive.\n\nI need to make sure that each objective is a complete sentence and starts with the correct verb. Also, the examples given in the user's message have similar structure. Let me check the example again: \"Understand the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics in field theory\", \"Analyze the mathematical foundations of relativistic quantum field equations\". So the objectives are about understanding principles, analyzing foundations, etc.\n\nYes, the six I have should fit that. Now, I need to format them as a JSON array of strings. The user specified to output only the JSON array, so no markdown. Let me make sure the JSON is correctly formatted with commas and quotes.",

Thex\u00b5 is a vector in 4D spacetime that transforms like\n(13) under a LT. It is noting but a location of an event in 4D spacetime. And it is analogous to specifying\nthe location of a point in a 3D space. Therefore,x\u00b5 is called a 4-vector\nx\u00b5 =( x0,x 1,x 2,x 3)=( x0,~ x) ,\nwhere ~xis the usual three vector.",
