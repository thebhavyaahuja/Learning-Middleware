    "raw_model_output": "We are generating 6 learning objectives for the module \"Skills\" based on Bhavya Ahuja's profile and the critical requirements.\n The context provided includes his skills, relevant coursework, and education.\n\n Critical requirements:\n - Each objective must be 8-1: 8 to 18 words long.\n - Start with action verbs: Understand, Explain, Analyze, Compare, Evaluate, Describe, Apply.\n - Must be actual learning objectives (not placeholders).\n - Focus on theoretical and conceptual understanding.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Review the context: \n    - Languages: C, C++, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Assembly (Low Level), Bash\n    - Web/App Development: MERN Stack, Python Flask, HTML, CSS, JS, basic Kotlin\n    - OS/ Networks: Linux, Ubuntu, Networking Fundamentals\n    - Relevant Coursework: \n        CS: DSA, Operating Systems and Networks, Automata Theory, Design and Analysis of Software Systems, Computer Systems Organization, DBMS\n        Math: Probability and Statistics, Linear Algebra, Numerical Algorithms, Discrete Structures, Real Analysis\n\n 2. We need to create 6 learning objectives that are theoretical and conceptual, not just tool usage.\n\n 3. We'll choose verbs from: Understand, Explain, Analyze, Compare, Evaluate, Describe, Apply.\n\n 4. Each objective must be 8-18 words.\n\n 5. Output: Only a JSON array of strings.\n\n Let's brainstorm:\n\n Objective ideas (with word count and verb):\n\n a) Understand the principles of computer systems organization and memory management. (8 words)\n    - But note: the context says \"Computer Systems Organization\" is a course. We want conceptual.\n\n b) Analyze the behavior of algorithms in data structures and their time complexity. (8 words) -> This is from DSA.\n\n c) Evaluate the trade-offs between different database management system architectures. (7 words -> too short, so adjust to 8-18)\n\n Let's try to create 6:\n\n 1. Understand the fundamental concepts of operating system processes and concurrency. (8 words) -> This is from OS course.\n\n 2. Analyze the mechanisms of network protocols and their role in data transmission. (8 words) -> Networking fundamentals.\n\n 3. Explain the theoretical underpinnings of automata theory and computational models. (8 words) -> Automata Theory.\n\n 4. Compare the efficiency of different sorting algorithms in terms of time and space complexity. (8 words) -> DSA.\n\n 5. Describe the principles of computer architecture and how they impact system performance. (8 words) -> Computer Systems Organization.\n\n 6. Evaluate the mathematical foundations of probability and statistics in algorithm design. (8 words) -> Math course.\n\n But wait, we have to be careful: the context says \"Relevant Coursework\" includes:\n\n   CS: DSA, Operating Systems and Networks, Automata Theory, Design and Analysis of Software Systems, Computer Systems Organization, DBMS\n   Math: Probability and Statistics, Linear Algebra, Numerical Algorithms, Discrete Structures, Real Analysis\n\n Let's check word counts and adjust to 8-18 words.\n\n Revised ideas:\n\n 1. Understand the core concepts of operating system process scheduling and concurrency control. (8 words) -> 8 words.\n\n 2. Analyze the functioning of network protocols such as TCP and UDP in data communication. (8 words) -> 8 words.\n\n 3. Explain the theoretical models of computation in automata theory and their applications. (8 words) -> 8 words.\n\n 4. Compare the time and space complexity of common sorting algorithms in data structures. (8 words) -> 8 words.\n\n 5. Describe the architectural components of computer systems and their influence on performance metrics. (8 words) -> 8 words.\n\n 6.
