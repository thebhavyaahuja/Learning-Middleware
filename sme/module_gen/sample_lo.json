    "raw_model_output": "We are generating 4 learning objectives for the module \"binary arithmetic\" with a focus on the \"Binary Subtractor\".\n Requirements:\n - Each objective must be 8-18 words.\n - Start with one of the action verbs: Understand, Explain, Analyze, Compare, Evaluate, Describe, Identify.\n - Focus on knowledge and conceptual understanding (not implementation).\n - Align with course content development needs.\n\n We are to output ONLY a JSON array of 4 strings, each string being an objective in the format: [\"LO1\", \"LO2\", ...] but note the example shows the keys as \"LO1\", etc. However, the example output format is: [\"LO1\", \"LO2\", ...] meaning each string is the objective text.\n\n But note: the example says: \n   [\"LO1\",\n    \"LO2\",\n    \"LO3\"]\n\n However, the problem says: \"Generate ONLY a JSON array without any thinking process, explanations, or word counts.\"\n\n And the output should be: \n   [\n     \"LO1\",\n     \"LO2\",\n     ...\n   ]\n\n But wait: the example shows the strings as \"LO1\", \"LO2\", etc. but that seems to be the placeholder for the objective text? Actually, the problem says: \"Example: ['LO1', 'LO2', 'LO3']\" meaning that the output should be an array of strings that are the objective texts, but the example uses \"LO1\", \"LO2\", etc. as the string content? \n\n Let me re-read: the example says: \n   [\"LO1\",\n    \"LO:2\",\n    \"LO:3\"]\n\n But that seems odd. Actually, the problem says: \"Example: ['LO1', 'LO2', 'LO3']\" meaning that the output should be an array of strings, and each string is the objective text. However, the example uses the string \"LO1\", \"LO2\", etc. as the content? \n\n Clarification: The problem says: \"Generate 4 learning objectives ... Output ONLY the JSON array: [ ... ]\"\n\n And the example is: \n   [\"LO1\", \"LO2\", \"LO3\"]\n\n But in reality, the \"LO1\", \"LO2\" are just placeholders for the actual objective texts. We are to generate the actual objective texts.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Generate ONLY a JSON array without any thinking process, explanations, or word counts.\"\n\n So we output:\n\n [\n   \"objective text 1\",\n   \"objective text 2\",\n   ...\n ]\n\n But note: the example shows the strings as \"LO1\", \"LO2\", etc. but that is just an example of the structure. We are to write the actual objectives.\n\n Let's create 4 objectives:\n\n 1. Start with action verbs: Understand, Explain, Analyze, Compare, Evaluate, Describe, Identify.\n\n We have to pick 4 verbs from the list.\n\n Let's plan:\n\n Objective 1: Understand the concept of binary subtraction and its fundamental principles.\n   -> But we need 8-18 words.\n\n Let me try:\n\n Option 1: Understand how binary subtraction operates using place value and borrowing concepts.\n   Word count: 7 words -> too short.\n\n Option 2: Understand the conceptual basis of binary subtraction including the role of borrowing and carry propagation.\n   Word count: 8 words -> okay.\n\n But note: the problem says \"binary arithmetic\" module and specifically the \"Binary Subtractor\". So we focus on subtraction.\n\n Let's create:\n\n 1. Understand the fundamental principles of binary subtraction with borrowing and carry propagation.\n    -> 7 words? Let's count: \n        Understand (1) the (2) fundamental (3) principles (4) of (5) binary (6) subtraction (7) with (8) borrowing (9) and (10) carry (11) propagation (",
